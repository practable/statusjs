<h1>About</h1>
<p>We maintain a live check on our experiments that also includes automatic email alerts to our team's central mailbox if there are video/data outages. If you are having issues with an experiment, you can check here to see errors our system has detected.</p>

<p>Unhealthy experiments are removed from the booking system automatically, until they become healthy again. If you have booked an experiment that is currently unhealthy, your session may open but the equipment is unlikely to responsive, so you should book another piece of equipment instead.</p>

<p>We only check for the existence of live video and data streams, but NOT the quality. If you have spotted a potential quality issue, please contact us at RL.Eng@ed.ac.uk.</p>
